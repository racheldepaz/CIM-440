# Sno-Your-Room XR

## Description
Sno-Your-Room is a Helio app designed to theme your environment with snow-related objects. Drag and drop winter-themed 3D objects into your space and see the world with a snow lens while a holiday (royalty-free!) song plays in the background. 

This app uses the camera and a Magic Leap controller as inputs to create a completely modular experience.

To use, first allow all camera privileges. If you don't the canvas will just remain transparent.
## Notes
This app recommends users to give the browser Camera privileges. Its 3D models can only be seen with the
Magic Leap Helio browser.

When you click into the model section, the snow lens will automatically close.
