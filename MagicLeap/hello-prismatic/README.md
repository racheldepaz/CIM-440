#Prismatic

Prismatic is a declarative JS library for creating 3D content for the Helio browser.
Using simple HTML tags with inline attributes and CSS styling, you can easily render 3D content that pops off of the page and you can grab and place into your environment.

## Installing

If you use npm, run `npm i @magicleap/prismatic`. Otherwise, you can [download](https://creator.magicleap.com/downloads/prismatic) the latest release from the creator portal.

To add the minified version:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@magicleap/prismatic"></script>
```
